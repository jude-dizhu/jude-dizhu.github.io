<h3>Something about me</h3>
<h4>Why I build this website?</h4>
<p>I made this website for self-introduction.</p>
<p>Although I also prepared other materials, there are still things that cannot be covered by personal statement or CV. Through this website, I can show a vivid picture about myself.</p>
<p>I am always open to new things. Although I did well in most courses, there are certain things that I learned outside the textbook. Until last summer, computer programming was totally new to me. I never thought that I would introduce myself through pieces of codes. I took a class online and learned to write some basic programs through Python, my first language. When my codes passed the test and the correct answer jumped into the screen, I started to feel the charm of coding. After that, I acquired the second language, HTML&CSS, through another online course. It feels so amazing that I am now building this website using this awesome language.</p>
