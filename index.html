<h3>Something about me</h3>
<h4>Why I set up this website?</h4>
<p>I made this website for self-introduction.</p>
<p>Although I also prepared other materials like personal statement and CV, I still want to show a more vivid picture of myself. A website is exactly what I need.</p>
<p>Another puepose of this website, is to show that I learn something more than the textbook. Until last summer, computer programming was completely new to me. I like my school and my major, but I think I need something out of the textbook. I learned two programming languages, Python and HTML&CSS, all by myself.</p>
<p>Programming is a job that require one's patience. At the beginning, it took me hours to comprehend a piece of code, to write the easiest program on my own, and to detect the possible bugs inside the codes. However, I still remember the time when my code passed the test and the correct results jumped into the screen.</p>
<h4>About my major</h4>
<p>From my point of view, accounting is the numerical language that is widely used in business field. Some accountants are like <strong>journalists</strong>. They create information for both internal and external shareholders. Some accountants are like <strong>policemen</strong>. They probe into financial information, trying their best to detect the potential fraud.</p>
<h4>Which one do I like?</h4>
