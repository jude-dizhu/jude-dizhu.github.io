<h3>Why I build this website?</h3>
<p>I made this website for self-introduction.</p>
<p>In this website, I will cover only campus life, since I have already introduced academic performances and career goals in other materials such as personal statement and resume.Through this website, I'd like to show a vivid picture about myself.</p>

<h3>How this great idea occurred to me?</h3>
<p>I like learning languages. <strong>Chinese</strong>, which I read, write and speak every day, is a beautiful language with colorful history. <strong>English</strong>, my second language, is the most popular language over the world. <strong>Accounting</strong>, from my perspective, is also a numerical language that is widely used in business field.</p>
<p>However, not until last summer did I get to know this new language, <strong>computer programming</strong>. Before that, I never thought I would have the chance to introduce myself through pieces of codes. I took a class online and learned to write some basic programs through Python, my first language. When my codes passed the test and the correct answer jumped into the screen, I started to feel the charm of coding. After that, I acquired the second language, HTML&CSS, through another online course. It feels so amazing that I am now building this website using this awesome language.</p>
